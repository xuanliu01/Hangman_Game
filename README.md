# Hangman_Game
Create a Hangman game using Python, where the player guesses a hidden word by suggesting letters

## Summary 
In this project, a Hangman game has been created using Python, where the player guesses a hidden word by suggesting letters, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before losing.

## Languages and Libraries Used 
Python 

## Key Learnings
- Problem Solving: The project enhances the ability to break down a problem into smaller tasks.
- Conditional Logic: It strengthens the understanding of conditionals suan as if/else statements.
- Loops: Become more comfortable using loops to repeat actions until a specific condition is met.
- Game Flow Design: The game involves creating an enjoyable flow from prompting the user to enter guesses to providing feedback. 

## Challenges Overcame 
- Managing the game logic flow effectively was a big challenge. Ensuring that user inputs are valid, keeping track of incorrect guesses requires careful implementation.
- Debugging the code during development was challenging. 

## Additional 
- Enhancing the game with animation and visuals such as draw the Hangman figure step by step
- Sound effects or background music to enhance the user experience and add a game-like feel
